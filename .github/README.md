## Installation

For installation guide you can go to the [wiki](https://github.com/FrogProg09/my-linux/wiki) of the project. 
I've tried to keep it as simple as I could, with detailed instructions it shouldn't be hard to do it.

## Keybindings

Feel free to change and mess around with them, nothing will break if you know what you are doing after all.
Plus even I personally haven't come up with smth 100% convinient yet.

|Keybind|Result|
|---|---|
| Super + Return | Kitty |
| Super + D | Rofi |
| Super + E | Nautilus |
| Super + B | Bluetooth manager |
| Super + S | Hyprshot |
| Super + A | Wlogout |
| Super + M | Exit hyprland |
| Super + Q | Close window |
| Super + V | Toggle floating |
| Super + F | Toggle fullscreen |
| Super + H,J,K,L | Move focus |
| Super + 1-0 | Cange workspaces |
| Super + Shift + 1-0 | Move window to workspace |

This is it for now, in the future I'm gonna add cheatsheet to waybar
