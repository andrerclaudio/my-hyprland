## Installation

**The script should be fine, please report if something went wrong**

To install this setup I've created a script that will backup your cofings of programs that I use here in
~/.config/hyprland-oldconfigs/*version* directory

1. My script works only with files so that is why you have to make sure that everything is installed on your system:

```bash
sudo pacman -Suy
```
```bash
sudo pacman -S hyprland hyprlang hyprpaper hypridle hyprpolkitagent waybar rofi-wayland kitty nautilus mako starship git
```

```bash
yay -S hyprlock
```

2. Then you can copy my repo and run script that will install my setup:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/FrogProg09/my-linux.git
cd my-linux
bash install.sh
```

And this is it! Besides I think shell setup (I use zsh), which you will need to do yourself.


If you want starship promt to work, you have to add one of these lines to the end of shell config respectively:

.bashrc
```
eval "$(starship init bash)"
```

.zshrc
```
eval "$(starship init zsh)"
```

and ~/.config/fish/config.fish
```
starship init fish | source
```

## Keybindings

Feel free to change and mess around with them, nothing will break if you know what you are doing after all.
Plus even I personally haven't come up with smth 100% convinient yet.

|Keybind|Result|
|---|---|
| Super + Return | Kitty |
| Super + D | Rofi |
| Super + E | Nautilus |
| Super + B | Bluetooth manager |
| Super + S | Hyprshot |
| Super + A | Wlogout |
| Super + M | Exit hyprland |
| Super + Q | Close window |
| Super + V | Toggle floating |
| Super + F | Toggle fullscreen |
| Super + H,J,K,L | Move focus |
| Super + 1-0 | Cange workspaces |
| Super + Shift + 1-0 | Move window to workspace |

This is it for now, in the future I'm gonna add cheatsheet to waybar
